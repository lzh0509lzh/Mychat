The NHibernate logo seems to have been choosen in a logo contest that took
place sometime before 2008. Though there seems to have been some amount of
confusion, this thread from 2008-04-03 seems to agree on this:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/nhibernate-development/iG72nfvI_g4

According to this, the choosen logo was contributed by Andrew Mayorov. The file
he posted in that thread is the one archived in the "old" folder.

In the same thread, we also learn that the animal is a "dormouse", which is
known for its habit of long hibernation periods.
